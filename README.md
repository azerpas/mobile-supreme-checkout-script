# mobile-supreme-checkout-script-IOS

Forked to make some tests to it.


## Installation

Install it on IOS's shortcuts app as a javascript shortcut.
Just C/P or download it from your phone.
FR App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/raccourcis/id915249334?mt=8
You need to enable the share page from settings to use it on every app, incl Safari.

## Usage

Currently configurated to run after clicking on a product (script is adding to cart, and checking out, payment is optionnal).
You can configurate your size and color, the bot is picking up well.

**I have not yet tried the monitor function**

Run the script from safari's Shortcuts shortcut, make sure your address is saved on supreme's site by faking a checkout (address not filled by script to lower detection).
I would recommend to login to Google with Safari to not trigger recaptcha.
